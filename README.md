# What social problem are you working on?
    Mental Health and Awareness

# Brief Description of your idea:
      Our project is a browser extension for Google Chrome that allows a user
      to see what sensitive topics (e.g. triggers) are contained or mentioned
      in the audio of a Youtube video, before watching it.

# Technologies we had used in making the project.
    The ytdl javascript library
    The symbl.ai NLP API
    Google Chrome's extension API

# The problem it solves
      Right now, trigger warnings for sensitive topics online
      are not always used. A person may encounter their triggers
      while not emotionally ready, and their mental health would
      be made worse by this experience.
      
      Our project allows a person to have more information available
      about what sensitive topics a Youtube videos contains, and make
      informed decisions about when and how to engage with these videos. 
      
# Inspiration
      Inspiration for this project came from the way that many websites
      incorporate a tag system that allows users to filter and
      make choices about the content they consume. Youtube
      does not have a similar feature, and so this project
      fill in that gap.
